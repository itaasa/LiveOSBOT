# LiveOSBOT
The following project consists of four main components:
1. Bot script written in Java
2. Java classes to connect bot Script with database
3. Database created and managed using SQL
4. Android Application that will display data from the database to an Android phone.

These four components will allow a user to run scripts at home, but at the same time be able to monitor bots remotely simply using a phone connected to the internet.
